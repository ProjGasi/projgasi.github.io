## 💻 Projects

Here are some of my recent projects:

- [Project GASI](https://projgasi.github.io/) — Global AI Security Initiative – Protecting AI from Modern Threats.
Collaborative AI Red Team is a SaaS platform for collective AI security.
Companies using AI can securely share discovered threats and vulnerabilities.
The system aggregates these reports and automatically tests all participants against new attack vectors.
The result — shared resilience, faster mitigation, and a global red team for AI defense.
