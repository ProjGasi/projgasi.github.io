<p class="inter-small">
    Modern artificial intelligence models face a fundamental problem: a lack of high-quality, representative training data. Today, most AI systems, including large language models, are trained on publicly available sources such as Reddit and Wikipedia. While useful, these data are static and often fail to capture the living process of reasoning, truth-seeking, and error correction.
  </p>

  <p class="inter-small">
    Elon Musk recently emphasized in an interview that the focus is shifting toward synthetic data, specifically created for AI training. However, synthetic data cannot always replicate the real dynamics of human thinking, debates, and collective discovery of truth.
  </p> <br>

  <p class="inter-small"><strong>Why Learning from Live Processes Matters</strong></p>

  <p class="inter-small">
    Imagine equipping educational institutions with devices that record lectures, discussions, and debates between students and professors. These devices could capture not only speech but also visual materials like diagrams, blackboards, and presentations. This approach would allow AI models to learn from real interactions, where:
  </p>

  <ul class="inter-small">
    <li>mistakes are corrected during discussion,</li>
    <li>arguments and counterarguments are developed,</li>
    <li>collective understanding and truth emerge through debate.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="inter-small">
    This is not just text — it is dynamic learning, where AI observes how humans think, reason, and refine conclusions.
  </p><br>

  <p class="inter-small"><strong>A Question of Fundamental AI Safety</strong></p>

  <p class="inter-small">
    This approach is directly related to foundational AI safety. The better AI training is structured, the lower the risk that errors, biases, or vulnerabilities will propagate to real-world systems.
  </p>

  <p class="inter-small">
    Our project, a collective red-teaming AI system, creates a network of AIs that monitor each other, detect errors, and identify potential threats. If models are trained on live discussions and real reasoning processes, the number of potential threats reaching global systems is significantly reduced.
  </p><br>

  <p class="inter-small"><strong>Benefits of Learning from Live Data</strong></p>

  <ul class="inter-small">
    <li>Richer knowledge base — AI learns from real reasoning, not just static text.</li>
    <li>Development of critical thinking — the ability to analyze different viewpoints and identify contradictions.</li>
    <li>Improved safety — errors and potential threats are detected early, before deployment in real systems.</li>
    <li>Innovative approach to education and AI — integrating AI into the learning process to improve teaching and analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="inter-small"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

  <p class="inter-small">
    Shifting from static training on Reddit and Wikipedia to live learning from lectures and debates is a key step toward creating safe and robust AI. Only by observing real human reasoning and debate can AI learn to understand, reason, and assess risks.
  </p>

  <p class="inter-small">
    The better foundational AI safety is established, the fewer threats will reach the level of global systems, such as our collective red-teaming project, and the safer the future of technology will be for humanity.
